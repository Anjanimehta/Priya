This is a sub-branch....
The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. 
Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.
When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“
some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. 
Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
